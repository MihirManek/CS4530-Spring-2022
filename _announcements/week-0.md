Welcome to the course website for CS4530, Spring 2022! Over the coming weeks, we will be populating this website (and Canvas) with more information about the course.

We understand that all five sections filled up very quickly, and that there are many students who would like to register for the class, but were not able to.
**If you must take this course this semester to graduate, please reach out to your academic advisor ASAP.** The CS advisors have plans to help ensure that students who must take this class in order to graduate this semester will still be able to graduate in time. We (the instructors) do not have any ability to over-enroll our sections.
