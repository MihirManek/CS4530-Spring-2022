## Rubric Specification

## Submission Instructions

Submit your assignment in GradeScope. The easiest way to get into GradeScope the first time is to first
[sign into Canvas](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/60188) and then click the link on our course for "GradeScope". 
You should then also have the option to create an account on GradeScope (if you don't already have one) so that you can log in to GradeScope directly.
Please contact the instructors immediately if you have difficulty accessing the course on GradeScope.

You can also view the complete output from running the tests and linter on GradeScope. If you have any doubts
about the autograder, please contact the course staff immediately. In particular: if you are not able to reproduce
and debug test or linter failures on your local machine, **please** ask the TAs for assistance: otherwise you'll waste
an immense amount of time waiting for the autograder to complete, when you could get the same feedback in seconds running
the tests + linter locally.
