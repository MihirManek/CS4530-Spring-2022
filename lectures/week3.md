### Learning Objectives:
The overall theme of this weekâ€™s lessons is software engineering processes: how do we organize our (non-programming) activities so that we can build some software project as efficiently as possible? The lessons will center on these four themes:
* How do we understand what software we are supposed to build?
* How do we organize our development activities?
* How do we estimate how long a software project will take?
* How do we build an effective team?

### Important Dates:
