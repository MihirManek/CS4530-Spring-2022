### Learning Objectives:
This week's lessons will bring us deeper into TypeScript, discussing the asynchronous programming model. As a common use-case for asynchronous programming, we'll also talk about the REST architecture. In preparation for next week's focus on testing, we'll also talk about structured techniques for debugging.
